# NanoTech Real-Time Threat Detection and Response System (RTDRS)

The RTDRS is a cutting-edge, open-source project designed to enhance public safety using real-time technologies. It combines advanced AI models, secure blockchain frameworks, IoT sensors, and post-quantum cryptography to deliver robust threat detection and response capabilities.

## Features
- **AI Threat Detection**: Real-time object detection and behavioral analysis using OpenCV AI models.
- **Blockchain Framework**: Secure, immutable logging for data integrity and inter-agency collaboration.
- **IoT Data Simulation**: Mock IoT sensor data for live testing of environmental factors.
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive, web-based UI for monitoring and real-time alerts.
- **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).
- **Secure Networking**: Integration with Cloudflare Zero Trust and QUIC protocols.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rfc391/NanoTech.git
    cd NanoTech
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Cloudflare**:
    - Set environment variables for Cloudflare secrets:
        ```bash
        export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<your_token>
        export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<your_account_id>
        export CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_ID=<your_tunnel_id>
        ```

4. **Run the System**:
    - AI Detection: `python ./ai/object_detection.py`
    - IoT Simulation: `python ./iot_simulation/sensor_data_simulation.py`
    - Dashboard: `python ./dashboard/dashboard_app.py`

5. **Access the Dashboard**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all quantum-safe and post-quantum cryptography keys are configured before production.
- Follow DARPA and ISO guidelines for deployment in high-security environments.
