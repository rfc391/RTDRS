# Real-Time Threat Detection and Response System (RTDRS)

The RTDRS is a cutting-edge system designed for real-time detection, analysis, and response to potential threats in public spaces, critical infrastructure, and beyond. 
This project leverages AI, blockchain, IoT sensors, and quantum-safe cryptography to provide a robust counter-terrorism solution.

## Features
- **AI Threat Detection**: Real-time object detection and behavioral analysis using OpenCV.
- **Blockchain Framework**: Immutable and secure data logging with smart contracts for inter-agency collaboration.
- **IoT Simulation**: Mock sensor data for testing temperature, gas levels, motion detection, and more.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Web-based visualization of sensor data and alerts.
- **Quantum Cryptography Simulation**: Secure communication protocols.
