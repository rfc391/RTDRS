# Real-Time Threat Detection and Response System (RTDRS)

The Real-Time Threat Detection and Response System (RTDRS) is a next-generation, open-source framework that integrates cutting-edge technologies to enhance public safety, critical infrastructure monitoring, and defense operations. The system is designed to meet military-grade standards, emphasizing security, performance, and adaptability in mission-critical scenarios.

## Key Features

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
- **Kafka** and **RabbitMQ** for high-throughput, reliable event streaming.
- Support for real-time data pipelines and geo-distributed processing.

### 2. **AI and ML Integration**
- **OpenCV** and **ONNX** for real-time object detection and behavioral analysis.
- **NVIDIA Triton** and **TensorRT** for optimized AI model inference on GPUs.
- Support for advanced signal processing with the **FES (Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing)** engine.

### 3. **Low-Latency Communication**
- **gRPC with Protobuf** for high-performance, low-latency communication.
- **Quiche/HTTP3** for secure and fast data transport.

### 4. **Databases**
- **Time-Series Storage**: InfluxDB for telemetry and sensor data.
- **Transactional Databases**: PostgreSQL/Cloudflare D1 for dynamic data storage.
- **Immutable Storage**: immudb combined with IPFS for secure archival and blockchain integration.

### 5. **Advanced Security**
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Cloudflare Zero Trust for network security.
- **Quantum-Safe Encryption**: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).
- **FIPS 140-3 compliance** for cryptographic modules.

### 6. **Decentralized Storage**
- **IPFS Cluster** for scalable, immutable, and decentralized archival of critical data.

### 7. **Standards and Compliance**
- Fully aligned with **ISO 27001**, **GDPR**, and **CMMC 2.0**.
- Designed to meet **DARPA-aligned** principles and **NIST 800-171** standards.

### 8. **Performance Optimization**
- **Cloudflare Workers** for edge computing.
- **Redis** for caching and low-latency data retrieval.
